# Sing-or-play-along

## Introduction
This will become an application web (and maybe app) that:

- will enable you to store chordpro-annotated songs in an online database (under your own account)
- give you a website to browse the songs, tag them, create playlists with them.
- watch your formatted chopro files and fiddle with them (probably by incorporating  [ChordSheetJS](https://github.com/martijnversluis/ChordSheetJS) and [ChordFiddle](https://github.com/martijnversluis/ChordFiddle))

- and - most important - give you the opportunity to share the song that you actually see on your screen with a group of subscriber who can read the songtext on
their phones and sing along with you!

## Frameworks
This appication will be build on:
- [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
